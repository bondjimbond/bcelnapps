            <div class="survey-welcome"><div style="text-align: left;">

	<p>

		Since the closure of AEMAC in 2010, Langara College has operated and maintained a streaming video service on behalf of public post-secondary libraries. They no longer have the capacity to do so and requested that BC ELN take on the management of the service. At its meeting on May 21, 2014, the BC ELN Steering Committee approved an investigation of the feasibility of this project.</p>

	<br />

	<p>

		This service is based on the IRIS Education platform, which offers shared content hosting, streaming video, and access controls to limit shared content to license holders.</p>

	<br />

	<p>

		This survey has two purposes:</p>

	<br />

	<ol>

		<li>

			To determine if libraries wish to continue accessing the existing shared collection of streaming media, and</li>

		<br />

		<li>

			To determine if there is interest in creating institution-specific accounts for the hosting of additional streaming media content licensed by individual libraries.</li>

	</ol>

	<br />

	<p>

		Responses are due by <strong>Monday, September 15. </strong>Please submit one response per institution. Responses will be taken as firm commitments. However, institutions that opt out will still have the opportunity to join in the future.</p>

		The existing shared collection was created by AEMAC in 2009. It includes 45 titles selected by media librarians and licensed on a perpetual basis for all BC public post-secondary libraries. See <a href="http://www.eln.bc.ca/docs/view.php?id=1381">the full list</a> for titles.</p>

	<p class="p1">

		It is hosted on a streaming media technology platform provided by IRIS Education, a Seattle-based not-for-profit company.</p>

	<p>

		The annual cost of storage and bandwidth is $1,250 per year. This cost, which has previously been covered by Langara College using funds collected in 2010, will be divided among institutions that choose to participate. We estimate that between 5 and 15 libraries will choose to participate, and therefore the annual cost will be less than $200 per library.</p>

	<p>

		 </p>

	<p>

		Regrettably, when AEMAC negotiated perpetual streaming rights for this content in 2009 it was only on behalf of BC public post-secondary institutions. Non-public and non-BC institutions are not eligible to participate.</p>

	BC ELN has negotiated with IRIS Education to offer a group discount on institutional accounts for their streaming media platform. This will provide a video streaming and hosting solution to any interested BC ELN partner library.

	<p>

		 </p>

	<p>

		The license includes:</p>

	<p>

		 </p>

	<ul>

		<li>

			A video streaming platform</li>

		<li>

			Hosting for any additional video content owned or licensed by the library</li>

		<li>

			The ability to add content at any time</li>

		<li>

			If your institution does not have the capability to rip DVDs and upload the video, IRIS Education can do so for an additional fee</li>

	</ul>

	<p>

		 </p>

	<p>

		BC ELN will coordinate the licence with IRIS and handle invoicing, similar to a regular database licence. Individual institutions are responsible for licensing and uploading content.</p>

	<p>

		 </p>

	<ul>

		<li>

			Discounted annual cost (final amount depends on participation, likely in the range of $1,200 to $1,500)</li>

			Setup fee waived</li>

		<li>

			Fixed annual fee – no additional cost for bandwidth or storage, within reasonable limits</li>

		Institutions that already have an account with IRIS will be able to join the consortial license at this lower price. Institutions that choose to join later will be able to do so.</p>
